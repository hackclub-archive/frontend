## Getting Started

    # Install dependencies
    $ yarn install
    
Create a file called `.env` with the following contents, replacing "REPLACEME" with actual values:

```
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=REPLACEME
REACT_APP_SLACK_CLIENT_ID=REPLACEME
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_TOKEN=REPLACEME
```

    # Start development server
    $ yarn start
    
    # Build for deployment
    $ yarn build
    
    # Run tests (there currently aren't any tests)
    $ yarn test
